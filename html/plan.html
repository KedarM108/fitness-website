        <h2>Cardiovascular Exercises</h2>
        <p>
          Cardiovascular exercise, also known as aerobic exercise, is any type of physical activity that raises your heart rate and breathing rate and requires the use of oxygen. This type of exercise is beneficial for improving cardiovascular health, enhancing endurance and stamina, burning calories, and promoting overall well-being.<br>

Some common types of cardiovascular exercises include:<br>

1.Running/jogging<br>
2.Cycling<br>
3.Swimming<br>
4.Rowing<br>

Cardiovascular exercise can be performed at different intensities, durations, and frequencies to meet individual fitness goals and needs. It is recommended to aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity cardiovascular exercise per week, spread out over several days. It's important to consult with a healthcare provider before starting any new exercise routine, especially if you have any pre-existing medical conditions or concerns.

        <h2>Strength Training Exercises</h2>
        <p>Strength training exercises, also known as resistance training or weight training, are exercises that involve working against resistance to build strength, endurance, and muscle mass. These exercises typically involve using external weights or resistance, such as dumbbells, barbells, resistance bands, or weight machines, to challenge the muscles and improve their capacity to perform work.<br>

          Some common types of strength training exercises include:<br>
          
          1. Squats<br>
          2. Deadlifts<br>
          3. Lunges<br>

          Strength training exercises can be performed using different resistance levels, repetitions, and sets, to target different muscle groups and achieve different fitness goals. It is recommended to include strength training exercises in your exercise routine at least two days per week, targeting all major muscle groups. It's important to use proper form and technique when performing strength training exercises to avoid injury and achieve maximum benefits. It's also recommended to consult with a healthcare provider or certified fitness professional before starting any new strength training routine, especially if you have any pre-existing medical conditions or concerns.

        <img src="stretching.svg" alt="Flexibility Exercises">
        <h2>Flexibility Exercises</h2>
        <p>Strength flexibility exercises are a type of exercise that combines elements of strength training with stretching to improve both muscular strength and flexibility. These exercises can help improve joint range of motion, balance, and overall physical function.<br>

          Here are some examples of strength flexibility exercises:<br>
          
          1. Yoga poses, such as downward dog, warrior II, and tree pose.<br>
          2. Pilates exercises, such as the plank, side plank, and the hundred.<br>
          3. Resistance band stretches, such as the chest stretch and hamstring stretch.<br>
          4. Dynamic stretching exercises, such as leg swings and arm circles.<br>
          5. Foam rolling, which is a type of self-myofascial release technique that can help release tension in the muscles and improve flexibility.<br>
          6. Bodyweight exercises that incorporate stretching, such as the cobra pose, downward dog push-up, and scorpion push-up.<br>
          
          Strength flexibility exercises can be performed as part of a regular exercise routine or as a standalone practice. It's important to use proper form and technique when performing these exercises to avoid injury and achieve maximum benefits. It's also recommended to consult with a healthcare provider or certified fitness professional before starting any new strength flexibility routine, especially if you have any pre-existing medical conditions or concerns.</p>

For example, a HIIT workout might involve 20 seconds of all-out effort followed by 10 seconds of rest or low-intensity exercise, repeated for several rounds.
          
          It's important to use proper form and technique when performing HIIT exercises to avoid injury and achieve maximum benefits. It's also recommended to consult with a healthcare provider or certified fitness professional before starting any new exercise routine, especially if you have any pre-existing medical conditions or concerns.</p>
